  * As the PHP script below tries to set cookies, it must be called
  * before any output is sent to the user's browser. Once the script
  * has finished running, the HTML code needed to display the ad is
  * stored in the \$adArray array (so that multiple ads can be obtained
  * by using mulitple tags). Once all ads have been obtained, and all
  * cookies set, then you can send output to the user's browser, and
  * print out the contents of \$adArray where appropriate.
  *
  * Example code for printing from \$adArray is at the end of the tag -
  * you will need to remove this before using the tag in production.
  * Remember to ensure that the PEAR::XML-RPC package is installed
  * and available to this script, and to copy over the
  * lib/xmlrpc/php/openads-xmlrpc.inc.php library file. You may need to
  * alter the 'include_path' value immediately below.
